#Mars Weather Data Analysis
#This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project that analyzes weather data from Mars. The project #is divided into two parts: scraping Mars news and analyzing Martian weather patterns. The weather #data includes minimum temperatures and atmospheric pressure at Curiosity's location.

#Project Structure
#part_1_mars_news.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook that scrapes recent news articles about Mars exploration.
#part_2_mars_weather.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook that processes and analyzes Martian weather data, #including temperature trends, atmospheric pressure, and estimating the length of a Martian year.
#martian_data.csv: The CSV file containing the processed weather data used in part 2 of the project.

#Data Overview
#The Martian weather data includes the following columns:

#id: Unique identifier for each observation.
#terrestrial_date: The Earth date of the observation.
#sol: The number of Martian days since Curiosity landed.
#ls: Solar longitude, which can be used to determine the season on Mars.
#month: The Martian month.
#min_temp: Minimum temperature (in Celsius) recorded on Mars.
#pressure: Atmospheric pressure (in Pascals) recorded at Curiosityâ€™s location.
#Analysis
#Minimum Temperature: The daily minimum temperature is analyzed over time to observe patterns and #estimate seasonal variations.
#Atmospheric Pressure: The atmospheric pressure is analyzed to observe its variation over time and how #it relates to temperature changes.
#Year Length Estimation: Using temperature cycles, the number of Earth days in a Martian year is #estimated.
